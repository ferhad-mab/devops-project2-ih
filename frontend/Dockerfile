# ---- Stage 1: Build the app ----
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files first (better layer caching)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the source code
COPY . .

# Build the app (Vite output goes to /dist)
RUN npm run build

# ---- Stage 2: Serve the app with Nginx ----
FROM nginx:alpine

# Remove default Nginx website
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# Copy built files from previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for the web server
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
